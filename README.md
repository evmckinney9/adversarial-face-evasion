## Adversarial Face Evasion
This TensorFlow project aims to modify an input image in order to evade detection by a face detection model. The modified image should be as inconspicuous as possible. A future goal is to use face meshes, AR, and a 3D model of glasses to create a model that can be robustly applied to a variety of faces and camera angles.

### Notes
- Project is currently in development, but is mostly just a sandbox for me to learn something new
- ChatGPT is being utilized to aid in the development process (just for fun!)
